Hi! This is my first post. I still haven't figured out what sort of content I want to write about (engineering? baking? gardening?), but generally, I'd like to spend some time talking about whatever interests me, including hobbies and work.

I just started a new job at Twitch after a few months on the interviewing circuit. Here are some stats: in total, I interviewed with about **25 companies**. Of those companies, I completed **12 phone screens**, and **5 of them** let me skip directly to the onsite. Finally, I had **10 onsite interviews**, of which I received just **2 offers** (it was almost 3, but one of them ran out of headcount...). As you can see, this is a < 10% acceptance rate from application to offer, and around 8 companies dropped out at each stage.

The recruiting process varied greatly from company to company. I was impressed with the quality of some recruiters (Stripe!) and not so impressed with others (Lime...). I was particularly struck by how much thought and effort Stripe put into prepping its candidates and ensuring a good experience for the interviewee. However, overall, it was a long and stressful process, and one I'm glad to be done with for a while. Shout out to Celia, Calvin, Vivian, Josh, and Mike who gave me good advice and encouragement throughout my experience!

Anyway, now that things are slowing down, I'm hoping to spend more time on my hobbies. I just received an aerogarden for Christmas, which has been growing extremely well. I might spend more time on baking as well. Finally, I have an [OP-Z](https://teenage.engineering/products/op-z) keyboard which I've been neglecting for a while.

Here's a picture of my aerogarden plants!
