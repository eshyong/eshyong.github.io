I still haven&rsquo;t figured out what sort of content I want to write about (engineering? baking? gardening?), but generally this will be a place for whatever thoughts I have at the moment.</p>
<p>I just started a new job at Twitch after a few months on the interviewing circuit. Here are some stats: in total, I interviewed with about <strong>25 companies</strong>. I was referred to <strong>7 of those companies</strong>, while <strong>the other 18</strong> reached out over various platforms, such as email, Triplebyte, or LinkedIn. Of those companies, I completed <strong>12 phone screens</strong>, and <strong>5 of them</strong> let me skip directly to the onsite. Finally, I had <strong>10 onsite interviews</strong>, of which I received just <strong>2 offers</strong> (it was almost 3, but one of them ran out of headcount&hellip;). As you can see, this is a <strong>&lt; 10%</strong> acceptance rate from application to offer, and <strong>around 8</strong> companies dropped out at each stage.Below is a picture of my interviewing schedule last year.</p>
<p><img src="/interview_schedule.png" alt="interview schedule" title="my interviewing schedule"></p>
<p>The recruiting process varied greatly from company to company. I was impressed with the quality of some recruiters (Stripe!) and not so impressed with others (Lime&hellip;). I was particularly struck by how much thought and effort Stripe put into prepping its candidates and ensuring a good experience for the interviewee. However, overall, it was a long and stressful process, and one I&rsquo;m glad to be done with for a while. Shout out to Celia, Calvin, Vivian, Josh, and Mike who gave me referrals, good advice, and encouragement throughout my experience!</p>
<p>Anyway, now that things are slowing down, I&rsquo;m hoping to spend more time on my hobbies. I just received an aerogarden for Christmas, which has been growing extremely well. I might spend more time on baking as well. Finally, I have an <a href="https://teenage.engineering/products/op-z">OP-Z</a> keyboard which I&rsquo;ve been neglecting for a while.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a picture of my aerogarden plants!</p>
