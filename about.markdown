Hi, I'm a software engineer working with data at Twitch. I've been at various startups of different sizes and worn many different hats. I've done devops, infra, fullstack, backend development and even did IT at 23andMe (for a brief 3 months).

I'm interested in working with big data and helping scientists find insights into their business. It started with working on the backend risk team at Affirm, a fintech startup. There, I learned how loan underwriting works and the factors that go into making thousands of credit decisions per day. I really enjoyed collaborating with data scientists on new experiments and features, and I hope to do the same at Twitch.

In my spare time, I like to read books, eat, and play with my Nintendo Switch. I'm planning to work on bigger side projects this year and get more into baking and gardening.
